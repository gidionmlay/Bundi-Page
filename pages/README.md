### HTML Pages
- All core HTML files are in the `/pages/` directory.

### CSS Files
- Each HTML page has a corresponding CSS file in the `/css/` directory.
- Use relative paths to link styles:
  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../css/login.css">
<script src="../js/main.js"></script>
<img src="../assets/images/logo-white.jpg" alt="Logo">
